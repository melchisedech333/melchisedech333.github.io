<p>

  Currently the texts are written in Brazilian Portuguese, but in the future I will also write them in English.

  My <i>website</i> is divided into a few general areas, these being mainly my areas of study interest.
  In it you will find my Curriculum Vitae, technical stuff, fun stuff, codes, jokes, poems, prayers, stuff about God, cool science experiments and much more xD
  
  <b>Areas:</b>

  - :man: <b>PortfÃ³lio</b>, To access my Curriculum Vitae.

  - :computer: <b>Cyber</b>, where are my software projects, codes and little jokes like that.

  - :older_man: <b>Deus</b>, where I post things about my Lord Jesus Christ s2

  - :pencil2: <b>Poesia</b>, where I wander between the words.

  - :microscope: <b>CiÃªncia</b>, where I play with cool experiments.
